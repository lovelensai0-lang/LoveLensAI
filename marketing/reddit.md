**[Launch] LoveLens AI â€“ Your AI soulmate, powered by Web3 (Polygon Amoy)**

Hey r/crypto & r/ArtificialIntelligence!

Weâ€™re excited to introduce **LoveLens AI**, a digital companion that blends GPT-based conversation with blockchain token gating. This AI is empathetic, supportive, playful, and yes â€” a little romantic.

**How it works:**
- Chat with LoveLens AI for free on our site. The free tier offers five heartfelt responses.
- If you vibe with it, you can mint a **LoveLens Access Pass** on Polygon Amoy (Unlock Protocol) to unlock unlimited conversations.
- The pass is an NFT â€” your key to premium access. Itâ€™s currently on the Amoy testnet, so no real cost involved.

We built LoveLens AI to explore how Web3 can power more meaningful interactions with AI. This is an experiment as much as a product, and weâ€™d love your thoughts.
